mega-clock
==========

7 Segment clock developed at "RT Labor Campus Bocholt".

I run the source code on my Raspberry Pi.

The communiaction layer between the pi and the clock is SPI. Implemented with the extra library WiringPi.

In the future you find the hardware layout and pickinglist at http://42volt.de/?page_id=420.

Needed Libs:

- wiringPi
- Boost

Have fun with my code. :-)
